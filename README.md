## Plant Pest Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatically detecting pests in plant images.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify images containing various types of pests affecting plants. 

### Functionality

The CNN takes digital images of plants as input and outputs the probability of pest presence. Optionally, the model can be extended to localize detected pests within the image.

### Technical Approach

The CNN architecture leverages convolutional layers to extract features from the images, followed by pooling layers for dimensionality reduction. Activation layers introduce non-linearity, and fully-connected layers perform the final classification.

### Benefits

* **Automation:** This CNN automates pest detection, saving time and resources compared to manual inspection.
* **Accuracy:** With proper training, the CNN can achieve high accuracy in detecting pests.
* **Early Detection:** Early detection is crucial for effective pest management and minimizing crop damage.

### Considerations

* **Training Data:** The quality and size of the training data are critical. Ensure diverse images representing various plants, pests, lighting conditions, etc.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Tuning hyperparameters significantly impacts accuracy. Experimentation and grid search can help find optimal settings.
* **Generalization:** The CNN should generalize well to unseen plant images. Data augmentation techniques can help improve this.

### Getting Started

This repository is currently under development. 

**Future Steps:**

* Implement the CNN architecture in a chosen deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
* Train the model on a labeled dataset of plant images.
* Evaluate the model's performance and refine it as needed.
* (Optional) Implement pest localization functionality.

**Feel free to contribute to this project by:**

* Suggesting improvements to the CNN architecture.
* Providing labeled datasets for training.
* Helping with code development and testing.

**Disclaimer:** This is a basic example. A complete implementation requires coding the CNN architecture, training on a dataset, and potentially integrating pest localization.
